# Akka Cluster Demo #

added different configurations to run on Kubernetes - locally tested with Minikube
For Kubernetes you can use
- [DNS-Discovery](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-management/current/discovery.html#discovery-method-akka-dns-discovery)  or
- the [Kubernetes API](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-management/current/discovery.html#discovery-method-kubernetes-api)

from the [Akka Management](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-management/current/index.html) project to start your Akka Cluster.

## Endpoints

- GET /self-address: cluster address of the contacted node
- GET /cluster/members: all cluster members

Example:

```

```

## Run standalone

Either run from within sbt with `reStart` (from sbt-revolver) or even better with the provided
command aliases `r0` or `r1`. Or create a universal binary with `universal:packageBin`
(from sbt-native-packager) and execute the launcher at `bin/demo-akka-cluster`.

Provide the following JVM arguments:

- Node zero (like in `r0`):
  - -Ddac.api.port=8000
  - -Dakka.management.http.port=20000
  - -Dakka.remote.artery.canonical.hostname=127.0.0.1
  - -Dakka.remote.artery.canonical.port=10000
  - -Dakka.cluster.seed-nodes.0=akka://dac@127.0.0.1:10000
- Node one (likle in `r1`):
  - -Ddac.api.port=8001
  - -Dakka.management.http.port=20001
  - -Dakka.remote.artery.canonical.hostname=127.0.0.1
  - -Dakka.remote.artery.canonical.port=10001
  - -Dakka.cluster.seed-nodes.0=akka://dac@127.0.0.1:10000
